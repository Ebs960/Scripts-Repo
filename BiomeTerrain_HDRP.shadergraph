# NOTE: This is a placeholder that documents the required Shader Graph.
# Unity's .shadergraph format is editor-generated and not practical to author
# reliably by hand. Create a Shader Graph in Unity with the exact filename
# `BiomeTerrain_HDRP` and the following configuration and properties:

# Shader Graph Settings:
# - Target: HDRP
# - Master Node: Lit
# - Surface Type: Opaque
# - Double-sided: OFF
# - Alpha Clipping: OFF

# Properties (exact names):
# Textures:
# _BiomeIndexMap (Texture2D)
# _Heightmap (Texture2D)
# _BiomeAlbedoArray (Texture2DArray)
# _BiomeNormalArray (Texture2DArray)
# _BiomeMaskArray (Texture2DArray)
# Scalars:
# _ElevationScale (Float)
# _GlobalSnowAmount (Float, 0-1)
# _GlobalWetness (Float, 0-1)
# Arrays (exposed as Vector4[] via material):
# _BiomeTints (Vector4[])
# _BiomeParams (Vector4[])
#   x = tiling
#   y = snowRetention
#   z = wetnessResponse
#   w = isWater (0 or 1)

# Vertex Displacement (Vertex stage):
# - Sample _Heightmap using UV0
# - Multiply by _ElevationScale
# - Add to Position (Object) Y
# - Do NOT use world noise, tessellation, or bake heights into mesh

# Fragment (Fragment stage):
# - Sample _BiomeIndexMap (UV0). Read R channel, *255, round, clamp -> biomeIndex
# - Use biomeIndex to sample each Texture2DArray (albedo, normal, mask)
# - Use tiling from _BiomeParams[biomeIndex].x
# - Apply tint, snow (land only), wetness (land only), and water overrides as specified
# - Hook outputs to HDRP Lit Master:
#     Base Color -> modified albedo
#     Normal -> unpacked normal
#     Metallic -> mask.r
#     Ambient Occlusion -> mask.g
#     Smoothness -> mask.a (modified by wetness)
#     Alpha -> 1

# After creating the Shader Graph in Unity, assign the generated graph asset to the
# `hdrpTerrainShader` field on the `HexMapChunkManager` component or place it under
# a folder such that `Shader.Find("Shader Graphs/BiomeTerrain_HDRP")` resolves to it.

# End of placeholder.
